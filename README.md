## Downloads

To make sure you're downloading the latest binaries check the [releases](https://github.com/Xen-E/pcxx/releases) page.



## Building

PC++ built using the [Qt](https://www.qt.io) framework (**5.15.2**), that means you need to have a Qt toolchain installed in your system... Make sure to have the **Qt Designer** as well so you can open the project file.

#### Linux
Also make sure you have [TagLib](https://taglib.org) library in your system, If you use Linux (Debian/Ubuntu...etc) open the terminal and type:
```console
sudo apt install libtag1-dev
```
Arch Linux:
```console
sudo pacman -S taglib
```
#### Windows
In Windows you gonna need to download the source files and build it yourself, Nothing special just cmake stuff... Example:
```console
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF ..
make
```
> Notice that `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` will produce a **static** version which is important.

After that modify the Qt Project file (**PCxx_QT.pro**) and change the old library path to the new one.
